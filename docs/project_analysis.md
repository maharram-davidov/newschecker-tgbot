```
User sends URL → Extract content with BeautifulSoup → 
Extract sources with Gemini → Search verification with SerpAPI → 
Generate analysis report with Gemini → Send formatted response
```

#### 2. Text Analysis Workflow
```
User sends text → Extract sources with Gemini → 
Search verification with SerpAPI → Generate analysis report → 
Send formatted response
```

#### 3. Image Analysis Workflow
```
User sends image → Download image → Extract text with EasyOCR → 
Follow text analysis workflow → Send formatted response
```

### Analysis Components

#### Source Verification Process
1. **Source Extraction**: AI identifies mentioned sources in content
2. **Categorization**: Sources classified as official/news/person/document
3. **Web Verification**: SerpAPI searches for source validity
4. **Cross-referencing**: Checks against known reliable sources

#### Reliability Assessment
1. **Source Credibility**: Analysis of mentioned sources
2. **Cross-verification**: Comparison with official sources
3. **Bias Detection**: Identification of potential bias
4. **Consistency Check**: Verification across multiple sources

## Security & Privacy Analysis

### Security Measures
1. **Environment Variables**: Sensitive API keys stored in .env (excluded from git)
2. **Input Validation**: URL and content length limits
3. **Error Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging

### Privacy Considerations
1. **No Data Persistence**: Messages not stored permanently
2. **API Data Sharing**: Content sent to external APIs (Gemini, SerpAPI)
3. **Telegram Privacy**: Relies on Telegram's privacy policies

### Potential Security Risks
1. **API Key Exposure**: If .env file is compromised
2. **Malicious URLs**: No protection against harmful links
3. **Rate Limiting**: No protection against API abuse
4. **Input Injection**: Limited sanitization of user inputs
